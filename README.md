This change is from the local environment!
This change is from GitHub itself.
This conflicting change is from the local environment
This is a conflicting change with VS code.


Although I had previously known about local to GitHub repository work, I somehow wasn't aware you could directly alter the files from GitHub? I knew the README could be edited but I somehow failed to notice you could theoretically code from GitHub itself. It doesn't make it a good idea, but still something I found interesting.



For my idea I want to create an interactive version of checkers that includes a chess-clock which is playable by two different players, or possibly Player vs. AI. The checker pieces will lift up and place down on the board as the user selects them, and when selected will highlight the options they can take. If the user wishes to undo a move they made, they can simply place the checker piece back or hit the interactive UNDO arrow button to reverse their choice. Until they hit the clock on their side, their turn is not over. The other user/AI will notice the changes take effect once the user's turn is completed, and the board is updated. Each checker piece is worth a score, and winning will also provide additional points. At the end of the match, scores will be tallied and available to view later by others playing on a separate page.

Key Features:
  Interactive chess-clock which will tick down over time until time has run out
  Checker pieces will pick up and place down as the user moves them
  Reversal by placing the checker piece back or hitting an interactive UNDO button given on screen
  highlighted squares showing what moves are available for a piece chosen
  Red/Blue crosses (in respect to which player it is) over checker pieces that will be eliminated at the end of the turn
  Tallied scores based on pieces eliminated or victory that can be viewed later by other players (organized by match, not total scores)
  Login page to enter your account and save your scores for bragging rights
